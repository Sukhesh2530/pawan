His immortality is tied to his ritualistic practices. If he is able to perform a specific ritual, he can transfer any damage he receives to his opponent, causing them to suffer as he does.<br><br>
Curse Technique – Jashin’s Ritual:<br><br>

Hidan’s primary ability involves a curse technique that allows him to transfer any injuries he receives to his opponent. He performs a ritual where he draws a symbol on the ground and, once he is in the center of it, any injury inflicted upon him is transferred to his target.
This technique requires him to be in the ritualistic circle, which he can create using his blood. Once the ritual is completed, he can inflict pain and damage on his enemies by enduring the same damage himself.
